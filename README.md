# TB-TMDC-edge-code
The Python codes, developed by Chandan K. Singh and Surjit Sarkar, implement tight-binding Hamiltonians for armchair and zigzag edges. These scripts are designed to calculate the electronic band structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers, given the hopping integrals and on-site energies. We have used the tight binding Hamiltonian from following work : Phys. Rev. B 88, 085433 (2013). We have reproduced the Fig.9 in the reported manuscript(Phys. Rev. B 88, 085433 (2013)) with edge width (N = 8).
