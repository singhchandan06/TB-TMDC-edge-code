# TB-TMDC-edge-code
The Python codes, developed by Chandan K. Singh and Surjit Sarkar, implement tight-binding Hamiltonians for armchair and zigzag edges. These scripts are designed to calculate the electronic band structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers, given the hopping integrals and on-site energies.
